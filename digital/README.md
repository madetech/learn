            <p>
              Delivery as a discipline is to deliver outcomes while considering the wellbeing and organisation of the team.
            </p>
            <p>
              To ensure the needs of users are met, continuous delivery is used. Continuous delivery is a practice which we use to provide value as quickly and efficiently as possible.

          <h5 class="card-title">Product</h5>
            <p>
              Product is used to identify and prioritise needs as well as opportunities. In addition, product also aligns teams around outcomes.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is crucial that teams are aware of context and vision of the product in order to meet user needs. This will empower teams to maximise outcomes and impact.

          <h5 class="card-title">Design</h5>
           <p>
              Design is framing the problem in order to understand user needs and existing/new digital services. User research is conducted to validate digital services to meet user needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital services must be designed with users in mind alongside iterative user research. We consistently test our designs using prototypes.

            <p>
              Using technical approaches and architecture, technology is built to meet user needs. Digital service releases are incremental, maintainable and reliable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Digital services are simple and they meet user needs. Risk of change is reduced as digital services are reliable and scalable.
