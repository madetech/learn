        <p>
          Delivery as a discipline is used to deliver outcomes while considering
          the wellbeing and organisation of the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          To ensure the needs of users are met, continuous delivery is used.
          Continuous delivery is a practice used to provide value as quickly and
          efficiently as possible.

        <h5 class="card-title">Product</h5>
        <p>
          Product is used to identify and prioritise needs as well as
          opportunities. In addition, product also aligns teams around outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is crucial that teams are aware of context and vision of the product
          in order to meet user needs. This will empower teams to maximise
          outcomes and impact.

        <p>
          Design is framing the problem in order to understand user needs and
          existing/new digital services. User research is conducted to validate
          digital services to meet user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital services must be designed with users in mind alongside
          iterative user research, consistently testing designs using prototypes.

        <p>
          Using technical approaches and architecture, technology is built to meet
          user needs. Digital service releases are incremental, maintainable and
          reliable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital services are simple and meet user needs. Risk of change is
          reduced as digital services are reliable and scalable.
