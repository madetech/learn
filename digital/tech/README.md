## What is Technology's role in Delivering Digital Services?
The role of technology towards delivering digital services is crucial. At Made Tech, modern technologies are used to build products that are tailored to the needs of you and your business. You can read more below to find out how knowledge of technology is improved consistently and what good tech looks like.

## What does good Delivery look like?
To improve technology within the organisation, it is important to be constantly learning. This could mean improving code quality, learning to work together as part of a delivery team as well as understanding how to solve problems.

We dedicate Friday afternoons towards developing teams using LearnTech. This is where new skills can be learned or existing skills can be honed. The core skills for technology represent the Made Tech leading practices within software development such as Test Driven Development (TDD), Web Application Development with React, C# and Frontend Development. These core skills are what engineers work towards, however core skills are always being updated and if there is a need for a new core skill, it is discussed, reviewed and shared with the wider team. Internal delivery teams are not limited to a specific technology stack - programming languages, frameworks, developer tools, etc. Instead, engineers are encouraged to improve polyglotism and write clean code so that products are meeting the needs of you and your organisation.
