## Workshop

What are:
  - Classes?
  - Objects?
  - Methods?

What's the difference between a Module and a Class?

Can you name and discuss the differences between the three method access control levels for classes and modules?

Can you discuss the difference between an Array and a Hash?

In a hash of:

```ruby
  workshop_hash = { foo: 1, bar: '5', 'baz': 'yolo', 'qux' => 24  }
```

how could you extract the values for each item individually? How could you get all the values at once?

What are some different methods of looping over arrays?

Given the code:

```ruby
  5.next.next
```

what would be returned?

In the following array:

```ruby
  workshop_array = [ 1, 'foo', 5, 'bar', :baz ]
```

What are some ways to extract the first, third and fifth values?

In the following array:

```ruby
  another_array = [1, 20, 42, 6, 10]
```

What are some ways to add all of the values together?
