# Test Doubles

At Made Tech we have adopted the Martin Fowler terminology of test doubles. 
You can read an in depth explanation of test doubles on his website.  
When using one of these test doubles you should be able to 
explain which type you are using.

* Dummy
* Stubs
* Spies
* Fake
* True Mocks

## Reading material

* [Mocks Aren't Stubs - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html)
* [Understanding Test Double Types](https://nirajrules.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/dummy-vs-stub-vs-spy-vs-fake-vs-mock/)

## Marking scheme

* Can identify the type of test double from code they haven’t written.
* Can hand-write each of the test doubles.
* Can explain when you should and shouldn’t use test doubles.
* Can explain why minimizing the number of test doubles a single test case uses is desirable
