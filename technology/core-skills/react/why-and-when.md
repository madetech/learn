### What situations is React suited for?

Things to think about when making the decision as to whether you should use React for a project:

- Does your application require a lot of client side business logic?
- Would the customer benefit significantly from having fast page load times?
- Do you need simple and reusable components?
- Could your application benefit from selective reloading? I.e. does anything on the page need to react?
- Is an existing customer development team already using React or NodeJS?
- Does your application require a lot of DOM manipulation?
