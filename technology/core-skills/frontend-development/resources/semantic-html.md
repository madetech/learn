# Semantic HTML

## What do we mean by 'Semantic'?
Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup emphasising the _meaning_ of the information that it contains.

This is in contrast to markup that focuses on _presentation_ or _visual structure_.

### Why worry about being 'Semantic'?

- It helps produce clearer, simpler code, which reduces total cost of ownership.

- It helps you, your team, and any of the next readers of your code, as they will find it easier to understand your original intent.

- It has benefits for [accessibility](/core-skills/frontend-development/resources/web-accessibility) - not everyone will consume your content the same way, so describing things more clearly will help.

## Examples

[This article](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/semantic-html/) has excellent examples of using the HTML5 semantic elements to produce more meaningful markup.

Mozilla highlights [some of these new elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantic_elements), and has [references and guides around their use](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
