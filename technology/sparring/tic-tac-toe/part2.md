# Tic Tac Toe: Part 2

You may have chosen to implement a web interface or a command line user interface, or perhaps another type of UI.

These UIs can be divided into two categories, client-side (e.g. web interface) and server-side (e.g. command line). 

Implement a UI from the opposite category.

## Considerations

* Avoid testing the same logic from multiple test suites
* Avoid coupling your business logic to specifics of different UIs (e.g. if ui == 'cli' then ... else ...).
* Can you deploy your game rules independently of your UI? Could your game rules be [packaged up into a separate Gem](../../guides/06-Gem-Packaging/)?

## Next Steps

Once you have implemented your alternative UI, go [here](./part3.md).
