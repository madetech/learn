# Learn a new language

We have found that [Koans](../koans/) have worked well for us.
Enabling us to gain a broad understanding of a new language's syntax in a very short window.

## Also to consider

* What dependency management tool does that community use?
* What build tool does that community use?
* What is the most common testing framework in that language?
* Is there a linting tool used in that language?
