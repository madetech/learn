    <h2>Recapping TDD and Testing Along the Spectrum</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        You <em>know</em> you should TDD, but do you struggle where to start? What's the difference between a unit, integration and end-to-end testing? And how do you write tests for existing code?
        Throughout this workshop we'll explore these ideas and more. Hopefully you'll come away with a greater appreciation for TDD, and more ways to embed it into your coding practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is suitable for <em>any</em> level of Engineer at Made Tech, and will involve lots of discussion, pairing and coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please bear in mind that the workshop will focus strongly on the  <em>in-person</em> experience.
