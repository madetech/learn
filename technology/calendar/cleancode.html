    <h2>Clean Code</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      This workshop is a chance to learn and discuss what we consider to be "Clean Code" at Made Tech, learn some coding principles, as well as practice some TDD & Pairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is suitable for <em>any</em> level of Engineer at Made Tech, and will involve lots of discussion, pairing and coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please bear in mind that the workshop has been designed to be an <em>in-person</em> experience, although we run a remote version of this course we will prioritise those who are <em>unable</em> to attend in-person sessions at an office.
