# Test suite performance

TDD relies on quick feedback cycles, 
therefore Delivery Teams SHOULD make it possible to run 
individual test suites within the ecosystem of an application 
in under 30 seconds. Furthermore, it SHOULD be possible to run 
the test suites of an entire application in under 5 minutes. 
If this time limit is exceeded, 
Delivery Teams SHOULD plan in effort to reduce test suite run times.

Test suite performance is also an indicator of structural defects.
