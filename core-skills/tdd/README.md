# Test Driven Development

## Summary

1. Can demonstrate using the discipline of TDD by doing it.
2. Can describe a broad range of strategies to achieve an acceptable test-suite performance.
3. Can describe the family of Test Doubles and can demonstrate how to hand-roll those Test Doubles. Can describe the problems introduced by Test Doubles on Test Design.
4. Is able to refactor a test to make it follow the 4 components of a single Test and also in relation to a suite of tests.
5. Can identify smells in test code, and describe why each smell is a problem.
6. Can demonstrate strategies to achieve Simulation of a "Remote Service". Can weigh up contextual appropriateness of common tooling (e.g. WebMock, VCR)
7. Can describe practical scenarios when TDD is not appropriate. Can explain what to look for when discovering new impractical scenarios.
8. Can demonstrate Triangulation and describe its relationship to TDD discipline.

## Mark Scheme

### Giraffe

![Giraffe](./giraffe.jpg)

#### Assessment

TDD a [kata](../../katas) or feature of your choice.  Keeping in mind the mark scheme below.

- Writes a failing test before writing production code
  - Required - Several examples of this.

- Watches the failing test fail for the right reason before writing production code
  - Required - Several examples of this.

- Writes only the minimum production code for a test to pass
  - Required - Several examples of sliming production code, or writing very minimal production code, until necessary to change by future tests. Examples of writing small tests to expose these.

- Watches the passing test pass before moving onto refactoring
  - Required - Several examples of this.

- Refactors tests
  - Required - One example of refactoring tests, describing why they are.

- Refactors production code
  - Required - One example of refactoring production code.
  - Can write tests which follow the AAAT (Arrange, Act, Assert, Teardown)
  - Required - Demonstration of setting up some state first, making an action, and asserting on that action. Teardown is optional if it is not required by the test suite (e.g. RSpec).

- Can describe expected behaviours from the perspective of the user.
  - Required - Can write test names which describe the behaviour of the software from a user’s perspective.

- Can describe the situations where using triangulation helps improve test quality.
  - Required - Can explain what the potential flaws of not including triangulation are.
  - Required - Can explain how triangulation overcomes these flaws.

- Can demonstrate triangulation when TDDing an example piece of code.
  - Required - Production code is generalised only when there are failing tests that require generalised production code.

### Wolf

![Wolf](./wolf.jpg)

You will be shown some preprepared test code, and will need to identify the test double used inside it.

You will need to create a test using each of the 5 test doubles, a Dummy, a Stub, a Fake, a True Mock and a Spy.

You will need to TDD a feature which interacts with a remote service of your choice, e.g. a class which retrieves Tweets from twitter.

- Can identify the type of test double from code they haven’t written.
  - Required - an explanation of a single test double in the existing test suite, including what it is and the purpose it serves in the test.

- Can hand-write each of the test doubles.
  - Required - write an example of a Dummy, a Stub, a Fake, a True Mock and a Spy, describing the purpose each serves.

- Can explain when you should and shouldn’t use test doubles.
  - Required - one example of when a test double is useful.
  - Required - one example of when a test double is NOT useful.

- Can explain why minimizing the number of test doubles a single test case uses is desirable
  - Required - a sensible example of how having too many test doubles can cause problems/problematic tests.

- Can explain benefits of the different ways of testing remote services.
  - Required - Can identify three methods of remote testing.
  - Required - Can explain the pros and cons of each.

- Can implement an appropriate method of testing a remote service.
  - Required - Passing test code which handles a remote service adequately.

- **DEPRECATED, BUT MUST BE ACHIEVED IF NOT DONE IN GIRAFFE** - Can describe the situations where using triangulation helps improve test quality.
  - Required - Can explain what the potential flaws of not including triangulation are.
  - Required - Can explain how triangulation overcomes these flaws.

- **DEPRECATED, BUT MUST BE ACHIEVED IF NOT DONE IN GIRAFFE** - Can demonstrate triangulation when TDDing an example piece of code.
  - Required - Production code is generalised only when there are failing tests that require generalised production code.

### Dragon

![Dragon](./dragon.jpg)

Review and refactor a preprepared test suite to improve performance.

- Can write an acceptance test around an existing feature.
  - Required - Write an acceptance test around a feature of an existing application which verifies the feature works as intended.

- Can identify smells within somebody else's code.
  - Required - Can list three valid smells per the invigilator's guide.

- Can describe why test suite performance is important.
  - Required - See invigilator's guide.

- Can identify causes of poor performance in a test suite.
  - Required - Identify three of the secret causes of poor performance.
  - Required - Explain one potential structural cause of bad performance in a test suite.
  - Required - Explain one other potential cause of bad performance in a test suite.

- Can refactor poorly written test suite to remove duplication.
  - Required - Can identify and remove three areas of duplication in the test suite.

- Can improve the performance of a slow test suite.
  - Required - Test suite run time is reduced 80% while maintaining the same amount of coverage.
  - Required - Test suite should remain as useful.
