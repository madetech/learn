# Demonstrating the Discipline

An Engineer with this core skill must be able to demonstrate the ability to follow this discipline religiously.

Test-Driven Development is defined as a discipline with three rules:

1. You MUST write a failing test before you write any production code.
2. You MUST not write more of a test than is sufficient to fail, or fail to compile.
3. You MUST not write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

## Marking Scheme

* Writes a failing test before writing production code
* Watches the failing test fail for right reason before writing production code
* Writes only the minimum production code for a test to pass
* Watches the passing test pass before moving onto refactoring
* Refactors tests
* Refactors production code
