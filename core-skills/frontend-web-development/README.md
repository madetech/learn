# Frontend web development [HTML/CSS]

## Aim
This course is intended to guide learning to a level where you can write and contribute semantic, and maintainable HTML and CSS to a project.

The course guides you through a typical "first page" build of any green field project. This encompasses selecting/creating a responsive CSS grid, building core shared components for your new application, and finally delivering an accessible, SEO optimised, lightning fast loading product detail page.

## Assessment Style
This core skill assessment is split into two parts. Firstly, you'll take a design from PSD to HTML/CSS during Learn Tech. This is assessed over three levels; Rhino, Narwhal, and Unicorn. Secondly, before completing each level as HTML/CSS is quite subjective you'll be asked to talk about the decisions you made whilst building out the deliverables for each level.

In addition to the deliverables, at each level you are expected to demonstrate:

- Pixel Perfect HTML/CSS (Your preferred browser)
- Responsive Design
- Cross Browser testing (Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari)
- Semantic HTML (i.e. no [Tag Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_soup) )
- Logical CSS naming

It is up to the assessor to determine whether or not you have adequately achieved the above in addition to the deliverables for each level.

As this isn't an assessment about scaffolding an application, and gathering resources we have built the (base application)[https://github.com/madetech/core-skill-frontend]. At this time this repo is private to Made Tech members, we're working to open source this too.

All PSDs and assets can be downloaded from [the core skill drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Qz7CXgspS7XYVpSXJEUcrrWwHklqNtb7)

- Pixel perfect components in their main browser at defined breakpoints, however when resizing the built html should reflow.
- Cross Browser tested
- Semantic HTML
- Maintainable well architected CSS

**Javascript is not required to complete any level.**

### Rhino

To obtain rhino you must present the following:

- How would open graph meta tags help discoverability?
- Which image format have you chosen to use? How would you optimize them if you had to?
