# Goals

If you are looking to focus on learning new skills, it's sometimes difficult to know what to focus on.

As we know, in order to do Deliberate Practice our learning must be **Goal Directed**.

In order of priority, here is a (non-exhaustive) short-list of some skills that we think that Software Engineers should know:

1) A range of skills which enable working in a team that is:
  - regularly showcasing productionized software to customers
  - keeping it's commitments
  - is building the right thing
  - continuously improving
  - is enjoyable to work with
2) [Test Driven Development](../core-skills/tdd/)
3) Acceptance Testing
4) Software Architecture
5) [Web Application Development with React](../core-skills/web-application-development-with-react/)
6) [Frontend Development](../core-skills/frontend-web-development/)
7) Continuous Delivery / Continuous Integration / DevOps
  - Using a PaaS
  - Using CI Tooling
  - 12 Factor
  - Philosophy of DevOps
  - Infrastructure as Code
8) Containerization
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes

Please feel free to use this list as a guide to help you and your mentors set goals on expanding your knowledge.

## Onboarding at Made Tech

Before joining a delivery team, and after following the onboarding guide in the handbook,
you will spend some time with a mentor focussing on skills relevant to delivery teams.

As a high level summary, we will cover the following -

1) Watch the [introduction to TDD screencast](../screencasts/tennis.md).
2) Pair with a mentor on some katas using Test Driven Development discipline.
3) Take a look at subcutaneous acceptance testing, and ATDD discipline.
4) Explore the three central components Clean Architecture 
  - Use Cases
  - Gateways (Adapter Pattern)
  - Domain Driven Design
5) Be introduced to the [Tic Tac Toe sparring exercise](../sparring/tic-tac-toe/)

## Core Skills

Our team has put together a set of [Core Skills with associated animal badges](../#recognition), which are [continuously evolving](https://github.com/madetech/learn/issues).

These are designed to enable new joiners deliberately practice skills which are valuable to delivery teams.
