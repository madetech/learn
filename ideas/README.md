# Learning Ideas

If you have some free time to learn by yourself, or in a pair, here are some ideas to help you use your time fruitfully.

## Code Katas

Go and do some Katas, either the ones [in this repository](../katas).

Or from one of the following sources:

* [Coding Dojo Kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/)
* [sleepyfox London Code Dojo](https://github.com/sleepyfox?utf8=%E2%9C%93&tab=repositories&q=dojo)
* [Code Kata](http://codekata.com/)
* [Code Katas](http://www.codekatas.org/)

## Repeat Code Katas

It goes without saying, but code katas are meant to be repeated.

Each time, you should focus on honing a particular part of your skill set.

You will pick up new knowledge as you finish workshops and seminars. 

Focus on applying that new knowledge in practice.

### Examples

* Focus on getting names absolutely perfect, break out a thesaurus and choose the absolute most precise words for the problem at hand.
* Is your code open for extension and closed for modification? Think of ways that it could be extended, and create plugin points
* Do your classes and methods have one reason to change? Can you increase cohesion by refactoring?

## Read

Pick up a book and read, here are a few that are invaluable

* Test Driven Development: By Example (Kent Beck)
* Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided By Tests (Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce)
* Domain Driven Design (Eric Evans)
* The Pragmatic Programmer (Andy Hunt)
* Clean Code (Robert C. Martin)
* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)
* The Clean Coder (Robert C. Martin)
* Clean Architecture (Robert C. Martin)
* Working Effectively with Legacy Code (Michael C. Feathers)
* Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby (Sandi Metz)
* The Software Craftsman (Sandro Mancuso)

## Watch

Watch screencasts and other programming related videos

* [Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts)
* [Clean Coders](https://cleancoders.com/videos)
* [Rails Casts](http://railscasts.com/)

## Go back over workshops

Can you apply the knowledge you picked up in a previous workshop or seminar in a new project.

Do you need to follow the guide, or can you remember what to do?

## Shadow others

If possible, arrange to shadow a team actively developing software.

## Code Review

Go and review some code. (You don't even need to comment).

* Read the code + understand it.
* Do you think it's well designed.
* Clone the project, try to run it locally.

## Work on a project

If you have a burning desire to build something, do so.

Make sure you're building it well, though.
