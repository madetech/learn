## Exercise 2

You are expected to practice TDD for this exercise

Create a process that can 

* Store a piece of data and assign it a unique key
* Lookup a piece of data by it’s key
* Fetch all pieces of data held

- You can use [this scaffold project](https://github.com/madetech/erlang-scaffold) as a basis for TDDing in Erlang.

### Retrospect

* Is your public API easy to use? Any improvements?
* Is your test suite designed well? How coupled is it to the public API?
