## Self-organisation

Figure out target mentor group e.g. if doing a MLD on TDD, this could be all the people who have done some TDD before.

- Ask individuals in your target mentor group to raise their hands
- Tell everyone else to find someone with their hand up
- Give clearly defined amount of time to pair or group up
- Be explicit about whether you expect pairs or small groups (3s)
- If anyone is left over, find them a group quickly and quietly

## Time Keeping

The format is 25 minute pomodoros on a global clock, with 5 minute breaks in between.

- You should enforce that everyone stands up, hands off keyboards.
- Using loud projected voice to get people's attention. 
  - Feel free to use Japanese words such as Hajime and Yame.
- Encourage people to mingle and chat about their progress.
- Allow people to discuss other things too.

## Coaching

Go around and look for common anti-patterns, examples:

- One person doing all the talking, using the screen or even making the screen unavailable to other people in pair/mob.
- Panic zone - one or more individuals unable to make progress.
  - You may not have the knowledge to get them out of the panic zone, avoid the temptation to be dragged into the panic zone yourself.
  - If you have the knowledge, ask them questions that help them get into the learning zone.
  - Explore with the learner how they might discover for themselves the knowledge that they are attempting to seek.
  - Find other teams who have that knowledge - suggest that they use the breaks to speak to them.
- Comfort zone - one or more individuals may not be challenged.
  - Ask them thought provoking open-ended questions
  - Challenge any assumptions that they have made
  - If possible, question any opinions that they have
