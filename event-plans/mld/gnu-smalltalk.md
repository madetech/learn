# GNU Smalltalk MLD: Worksheet

**You arenâ€™t expected to finish all these exercises.**

## Exercise 1

Goto [craigjbass/gnu\_smalltalk\_koans](https://github.com/craigjbass/gnu_smalltalk_koans) and follow the **Docker instructions**

## Exercise 2

You are expected to practice TDD for this exercise

Build a solution to the [Tennis kata](../../katas/tennis/) in GNU Smalltalk.

- You can use [this scaffold project](https://github.com/madetech/gnu-smalltalk-scaffold) as a basis for TDDing in GNU Smalltalk.

### Retrospect

- GNU Smalltalk is a really old language (first release was in 1972!). What can we learn from such an old programming language?
- Consider how a UI might use your Tennis game implementation. Do you think you could make any improvements?
