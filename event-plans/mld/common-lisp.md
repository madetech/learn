# Common Lisp MLD: Worksheet

**You arenâ€™t expected to finish all these exercises.**

## Exercise 1

Goto [craigjbass/lisp-koans](https://github.com/craigjbass/lisp-koans) and follow the **Docker instructions**

## Exercise 2

You are expected to practice TDD for this exercise

Build a solution to the [Tennis kata](../../katas/tennis/) in Common Lisp.

- You can use [this scaffold project](https://github.com/madetech/common-lisp-scaffold) as a basis for TDDing in Common Lisp.

### Retrospect

- Common Lisp has many dialects. Why do you think that is? What benefit does that provide?
- Consider how a UI might use your Tennis game implementation. Do you think you could make any improvements?
