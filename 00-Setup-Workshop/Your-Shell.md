# Your Shell

By default your shell is the `Bourne-Again shell` (bash) and it will be the default installation.

This is very minimal and most programmers choose to customise it or even pick an alternative shell.

The alternative shell [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) with [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) is easy to get going with which can be installed by running

`$ brew install zsh`

`$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh`

This will install a fairly comprehensive and useful set of helper plugins that make using the terminal much more enjoyable.

On top of this zsh is a superset of bash, so the two are largely interchangeable.
