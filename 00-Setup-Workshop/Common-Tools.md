# Homebrew cask

It's also possible to install proprietary software with Homebrew via `cask`

To enable cask:

`$ brew tap caskroom/cask`

## Stop and understand

* What is `tap`?

_Hint_ can you use `man` on your own? ;)

# Install common software

`$ brew cask install slack`

`$ brew cask install google-chrome`

`$ brew cask install firefox`

`$ brew cask install lastpass`

# Finalizing Last Pass

`$ cd /usr/local/Caskroom/lastpass/latest/`

`$ open Lastpass\ Installer.app`
