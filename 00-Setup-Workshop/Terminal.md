# Terminal

You will need to use a "Terminal Emulator" to run commands in this guide. 

macOS comes with a default Terminal, however you may find it a bit lacking.

Many people at Made Tech use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html), however there are also other terminal emulators such as [Hyper](https://hyper.is/).

You will see this `$` at the beginning of command. You shouldn't include it when you try to run a command.

## An aside

The `$` does have a meaning!

- `$` signifies you should run a command as your "unpriviledged user"
- `#` signifies you should run that command as root

# To Do

* Read up to 1.1 in [Learn Enough Command Line to be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) (just before "Our first command").
* Download an install an alternative terminal
