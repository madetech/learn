# Terminal

You will need to use a Terminal to run commands in this guide. 

macOS comes with a default Terminal, however you may find it a bit lacking.

Many people at Made Tech use [iTerm 2](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html) but [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) also exists.

You will see this `$` at the beginning of command. You shouldn't include it when you try to run a command.

# An aside

The `$` does have a meaning!

- `$` signifies you should run a command as your "unpriviledged user"
- `#` signifies you should run that command as root
