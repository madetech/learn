# Setup Workshop

One of the most under-taught skills is how to setup a good development environment.

Since you will be using macOS, and this might be your first time we will take it slow.

1) [Terminal](./Terminal.md)
2) [Build Tools](./Build-Tools.md)
3) [Your Shell](./Your-Shell.md)
4) [Common Tools](./Common-Tools.md)
5) [Ruby Version Manager](./Ruby-Version-Manager.md)
6) [Ruby](./Ruby.md)

# You should now be all setup

And hopefully you learned a lot along the way.

We've automated this process with [First-Boot](https://github.com/madetech/first-boot/), but it's important to understand what is going on!
