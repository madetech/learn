# Test Framework

For this Kata you need to build a test framework from scratch.

* It should provide some way to separate tests, so that users can follow the single assert rule.
* It should provide some way to name each test.
* It should have a plugin architecture. (Up to you to decide where flexibility is desirable).

Obviously, you should TDD your solution. (Some creativity required!).

## Variations

* Do you use another testing framework to test your framework?
* Do you bootstrap testing your test framework with the test framework?
* TDD another Kata using your test framework, how usable is it?
